\section{Scanner}

High-level explanation of scanner pipeline. 

\subsection[topology]{Topology extraction}

We employ pre-processing on the image to remove noise, then we classify each region with a unique id, and build an undirected graph describing which regions are touching. We call this a \textit{touch graph}. In the following, we describe an algorithm which extracts a tree given a touch graph.

\subsection[falsePositives]{Avoiding false positives}

We employed different strategies including CRCs, known prefixes, and known number of descendants.
