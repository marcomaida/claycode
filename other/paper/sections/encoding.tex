\section{Bit-To-Tree Encoding}

Intuitively, the optimal solution would be a bijection between binary strings and rooted, unlabeled, unordered k-ary trees. However, it is not trivial whether such bijection would yield trees that are wide enough to be easily packed in practice. Therefore, we opted for an empirical approach and explored different different encoding strategies and evaluated them.

\subsection[strategies]{Encoding Strategies}

We explain squares etc.

\subsection[encodingEval]{Evaluation}

We compare the different strategies among each other.

\subsection[generation]{Generation and data capacity}

We compare the data capacity of claycodes to QR codes using the best encoding strategy to our knowledge. Here, give an idea of how the packer works.
