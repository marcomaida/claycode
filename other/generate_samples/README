# Sample Claycode Generator

This Script generates a PDF with a number of Claycodes of different shapes. The PDF reports the useful metadata of the Claycode (date of generation, encoding, original input text).

Run `make` to generate. Only tested on Mac.

This script
- Deletes all old claycode samples in the `~/Downloads` folder
- Opens a special page of the generator website that generates and downloads all the generated Claycodes
- Organises the images into a PDF (saved in the same folder as this README)

## Under the hood
The relevant logic on the generator side is in `generator/scenes/scene_generate_samples.js`. This file contains the list of Claycodes that will be generated. 

In addition to the Claycodes, the generator produces a `metadata.json` file. This file is the last produced, and it is used by the Python script to detect when the web generator is done.
