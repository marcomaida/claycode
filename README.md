<!-- Claycodes are an aesthetically pleasing alternative to QR codes. 
Claycodes can encode arbitrary information inside an image which can be decoded at a later time. -->

## Abstract

This paper introduces Claycode, a novel 2D scannable code designed for extensive stylization and deformation. Unlike traditional matrix-based codes (e.g., QR codes), Claycodes encode their message in a tree structure. During the encoding process, bits are mapped into a topology tree, which is then depicted as a nesting of color regions drawn within the boundaries of a target polygon shape. When decoding, Claycodes are extracted and interpreted in real-time from a camera stream. We detail the end-to-end pipeline and show that Claycodes allow for extensive stylization without compromising their functionality. We then empirically demonstrate Claycodeâ€™s high tolerance to heavy deformations, outperforming traditional 2D scannable codes in scenarios where they typically fail.

## Structure of Repository

This repository contains all the implementation of the publication. In particular:

- `generator/`: a webpage that can generate Claycodes given some text,
- `scanner/`: an Android scanner camera app written in Kotlin,
- `experiments/`: miscellanea experiments related to Claycodes,
- `other/`: demos and media.

For further details please find instruction within each folder.
