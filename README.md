# Claycodes

Claycodes are an aesthetically pleasing alternative to QR codes. Claycodes can encode arbitrary information inside an image which can be decoded at a later time.

## Quick start

Make sure that the python package `SimpleHTTPServer` is installed (`make requirements`).

For MacOS run:

```
make
```

For Linux run:

```
make run-linux
```
